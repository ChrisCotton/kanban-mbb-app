### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `TaskCard.tsx` and `TaskCard.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- Glassmorphic styles will utilize Tailwind CSS classes with custom CSS for advanced effects.
- All components should be mobile-first responsive and follow the existing project's TypeScript patterns.

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 8 hours  
**Actual Time:** 8 hours  
**Completed:** January 11, 2025

#### Description
Create the foundational UI components for the kanban board with four swim lanes, responsive design, and comprehensive error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] KanbanBoard component with four swim lanes (Backlog, Todo, Doing, Done)
