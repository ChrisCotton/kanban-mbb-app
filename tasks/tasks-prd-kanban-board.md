- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `TaskCard.tsx` and `TaskCard.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- Glassmorphic styles will utilize Tailwind CSS classes with custom CSS for advanced effects.
- All components should be mobile-first responsive and follow the existing project's TypeScript patterns.
