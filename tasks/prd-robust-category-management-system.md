# Product Requirements Document: Robust Category Management System Redesign

## Introduction/Overview

The current category management system suffers from database schema inconsistencies and brittle design patterns that prevent users from successfully creating and managing task categories. This redesign aims to create a robust, error-free category management system that supports full CRUD operations, task assignment, and hourly rate tracking for Mental Bank Balance (MBB) calculations.

**Problem Statement**: The existing system has inconsistent column naming (`hourly_rate` vs `hourly_rate_usd` vs `p_hourly_rate_usd`) causing database errors and preventing category creation, leading to user frustration and broken functionality.

**Solution Goal**: Implement a consistent, robust category management system that eliminates database errors, provides seamless CRUD operations, and integrates effectively with the MBB system for time tracking and billing calculations.

## Goals

1. **Eliminate Database Errors**: Fix schema inconsistencies to ensure 100% success rate for category CRUD operations
2. **Improve User Experience**: Provide intuitive category management with clear feedback and error handling
3. **Enable Accurate Time Tracking**: Support precise hourly rate tracking for MBB calculations
4. **Ensure Data Consistency**: Maintain referential integrity between categories and tasks
5. **Reduce System Complexity**: Simplify the category model to prevent future maintenance issues

## User Stories

**As a user, I want to:**
- Create new task categories with custom hourly rates so that I can organize my work and track billing accurately
- Edit existing categories to update names and hourly rates when my work focus or rates change
- Delete categories I no longer need, even if they have been assigned to completed tasks
- View all my categories with their current task counts and hourly rates in one place
- Assign a single category to my tasks to enable proper time tracking and billing
- See my accumulated earnings per category based on time spent and hourly rates
- Export all my categories to a CSV file for backup, analysis, or sharing with external tools
- Import categories from a CSV file to quickly set up multiple categories or migrate from other systems

**As a system user, I want to:**
- Have confidence that category operations will succeed without database errors
- Understand why an operation failed if it does fail, with clear error messages
- See immediate feedback when categories are created, updated, or deleted

## Functional Requirements

### Core Category Management
1. **Create Category**: The system must allow users to create new categories with a name and hourly rate (USD)
2. **Read Categories**: The system must display all user categories with name, hourly rate, and task count
3. **Update Category**: The system must allow editing of category name and hourly rate
4. **Delete Category**: The system must allow deletion of categories, including those assigned to existing tasks
5. **Validate Category Data**: The system must validate category names (non-empty, reasonable length) and hourly rates (positive numbers)

### Database Schema Consistency
6. **Standardized Column Naming**: The system must use consistent column naming across all category-related tables
7. **Proper Data Types**: The system must use appropriate data types for all category fields (text for names, decimal for rates)
8. **Referential Integrity**: The system must maintain proper foreign key relationships between categories and tasks

### Task-Category Integration
9. **Optional Assignment**: The system must allow tasks to exist without categories (nullable foreign key)
10. **Single Category per Task**: The system must enforce one category maximum per task
11. **Category Display in Tasks**: The system must show the assigned category name and rate in task views
12. **Task Count Tracking**: The system must accurately count and display the number of tasks per category

### Mental Bank Balance Integration

### API Requirements
28. **RESTful Endpoints**: The system must provide standard REST endpoints for category CRUD operations
29. **CSV Export Endpoint**: The system must provide a GET endpoint (`/api/categories/export`) that returns CSV data with proper headers
30. **CSV Import Endpoint**: The system must provide a POST endpoint (`/api/categories/import`) that accepts multipart/form-data with CSV files
31. **Import Validation Endpoint**: The system must provide a POST endpoint (`/api/categories/validate`) for pre-import validation and preview
32. **Template Download Endpoint**: The system must provide a GET endpoint (`/api/categories/template`) that returns a sample CSV template
33. **Proper HTTP Status Codes**: The system must return appropriate status codes for all operations
34. **Error Response Format**: The system must return consistent error response formats
35. **Request Validation**: The system must validate all incoming requests and reject invalid data

3. **Rate Limits**: Should there be limits on the number of categories a user can create?
4. **Category Name Uniqueness**: Should category names be unique per user or allow duplicates?
5. **Deletion Confirmation**: What level of confirmation is needed for category deletion (simple confirm vs. typing category name)?
6. **Task Reassignment**: When a category is deleted, should tasks be automatically unassigned or offer bulk reassignment to another category?
7. **CSV Import Conflicts**: How should the system handle importing categories with names that already exist?
8. **CSV Export Filters**: Should users be able to filter which categories are exported (active only, by date range, etc.)?
9. **File Size Limits**: What are appropriate limits for CSV import file size and number of categories?
