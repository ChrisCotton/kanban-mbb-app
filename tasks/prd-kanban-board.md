# Product Requirements Document: Kanban Board with Swim Lanes

## Introduction/Overview

This feature introduces a sophisticated kanban board system designed for individual productivity tracking with integrated timing and mental bank balance accounting. The board features four swim lanes (Backlog, Todo, Doing, Done) with glassmorphic design aesthetics inspired by Apple Vision Pro interfaces. The primary goal is to provide users with a comprehensive task management system that tracks progress while maintaining awareness of mental energy expenditure and productivity analytics.

## Goals

1. **Progress Visualization**: Enable users to track task progression through clearly defined workflow stages
2. **Mental Bank Balance Integration**: Connect task completion and effort with mental energy accounting
3. **Comprehensive Task Management**: Provide full CRUD operations with rich task details including markdown comments and subtasks
4. **Analytical Insights**: Deliver impact analytics to help users understand their productivity patterns
5. **Immersive Experience**: Create a visually striking interface with glassmorphic design and cinematic aesthetics

## User Stories

1. **Task Overview**: As an individual user, I want to see all tasks across all columns so that I know what's currently being worked on, what is done, what is in todo, and what the priority of things are.

2. **Task Progression**: As a user, I want to move tasks from Todo to Doing to Done so that I can track my progress and maintain workflow momentum.

3. **Future Planning**: As a user, I want to capture and save future tasks in the backlog so that I can plan ahead without cluttering my active workspace.

4. **Detailed Task Management**: As a user, I want to add comprehensive details to tasks including markdown comments, subtasks, and due dates so that I can maintain complete context for each item.

5. **Mental Energy Tracking**: As a user, I want the system to update my mental bank balance based on task completion so that I can maintain awareness of my cognitive load.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Kanban Functionality
1. The system must display four swim lanes: Backlog, Todo, Doing, Done
2. The system must allow drag and drop movement of tasks between columns
3. The system must persist all task data to the Supabase database
4. The system must support unlimited tasks per column

### Task Management
5. The system must allow users to create, read, update, and delete tasks
6. The system must support task titles (required field)
7. The system must support task descriptions (optional)
8. The system must allow users to set due dates for tasks
9. The system must support priority levels for tasks
10. The system must support custom labels/tags for tasks

### Advanced Task Features
11. The system must support infinite markdown-formatted comments on tasks (similar to Trello)
12. The system must support subtask lists with checkboxes that can be marked complete
13. The system must integrate with the existing timer functionality
14. The system must update the mental bank balance when tasks are completed or moved

### User Interface
15. The system must implement glassmorphic design with blur effects
16. The system must include subtle animations for interactions
17. The system must use drop shadows to create 3D visual depth
18. The system must support cinematic background images behind blur effects
19. The system must implement a dark theme with striking analytics
20. The system must be mobile-first responsive

### Analytics and Insights
21. The system must provide impact analytics for task completion
22. The system must display visual progress indicators
23. The system must show productivity metrics and trends

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Multi-user Collaboration**: This feature will not support team collaboration or sharing
2. **Real-time Synchronization**: No real-time updates for multiple sessions
3. **Advanced Project Management**: Will not include Gantt charts, resource allocation, or complex project planning features
4. **Third-party Integrations**: No integration with external project management tools
5. **Advanced Reporting**: Complex reporting features beyond basic analytics are out of scope

## Design Considerations

### Visual Design
- **Glassmorphic Aesthetic**: Implement frosted glass effects with backdrop blur filters
- **3D Depth**: Use layered drop shadows and subtle transforms to create visual hierarchy
- **Cinematic Backgrounds**: Support for high-quality background images with blur overlays
- **Dark Theme**: Primary dark color scheme with high contrast elements for accessibility
- **Animation Strategy**: Smooth transitions for drag/drop, hover states, and state changes

### Reference Designs
- [Apple Vision Pro Music Player UI](https://dribbble.com/shots/21829180-Apple-Vision-Pro-Music-Player-UI) - Glassmorphic card design and blur effects
- [Crypto Wallet Trading Page](https://dribbble.com/shots/26026246-Crypto-wallet-trading-page) - Layout structure and visual hierarchy

### Component Architecture
- Integrate with existing Shadcn UI components
- Use Framer Motion for animations
- Leverage @hello-pangea/dnd for drag and drop functionality
- Implement with Tailwind CSS for styling consistency

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema
- Extend existing Supabase schema to include kanban-specific tables
- Task table with relationships to user, comments, and subtasks
- Support for JSON fields for flexible metadata storage

### State Management
- Integrate with existing React state management patterns
- Ensure seamless integration with timer and mental bank balance systems
- Implement optimistic updates for smooth user experience

### Performance
- Implement virtual scrolling for large task lists
- Optimize drag and drop performance with proper memoization
- Ensure smooth animations on mobile devices

## Success Metrics

1. **User Engagement**: Increase daily active usage by 25% through improved task visualization
2. **Task Completion Rate**: Improve task completion rate by 20% through better workflow management
3. **Mental Bank Balance Accuracy**: Achieve 90% user satisfaction with mental energy tracking integration
4. **Mobile Usage**: Ensure 80% of interactions work seamlessly on mobile devices
5. **Performance**: Maintain <100ms response time for all drag and drop operations

## Open Questions

1. **Mental Bank Balance Integration**: What specific algorithm should be used to calculate mental energy deduction/addition for different task types?
2. **Analytics Detail Level**: How granular should the impact analytics be? (daily, weekly, monthly views?)
3. **Backup/Export**: Should users be able to export their kanban data for external backup?
4. **Offline Functionality**: Should the kanban board work offline with sync when connection is restored?
5. **Task Archiving**: How should completed tasks be handled long-term? Auto-archive after a certain period?
