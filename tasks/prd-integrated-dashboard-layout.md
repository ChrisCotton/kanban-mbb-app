## Design Considerations

### Layout Structure
- **Header**: Navigation bar with responsive menu

- **Main**: Existing Kanban board layout
- **Footer**: MBB timer section with earnings display

### Visual Design
- Maintain existing dark theme compatibility

- Implement smooth animations for carousel transitions
- Create visual hierarchy that emphasizes the timer and MBB display

### Component Architecture
- Extend existing TaskCard component to include category display

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema Updates
- Add `category_id` field to tasks table
- Create `categories` table with name and hourly_rate fields
- Create `time_sessions` table for tracking work periods

## Open Questions

1. **Target Revenue Setting**: How should users set and modify their MBB revenue targets?
2. **Audio Storage**: What are the storage requirements and limits for audio journal entries?
